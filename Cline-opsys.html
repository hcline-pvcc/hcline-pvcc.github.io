      <td>Job queue</td>
      <td>data structure determining execution order of jobs residing in mass storage</td>

        <td>FIFO</td>
        <td>objects are removed from the job queue in the order in which they arrived</td>
      </tr>

        <td>Interactive processing</td>
        <td>feature in an operating system that allows a program being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote terminals</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Time-sharing</td>
        <td>operating systems that provide service to multiple users at the same time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Multiprogramming</td>
        <td>method of time-sharing where time is divided into intervals and then the execution of each job is restricted to only one interval at a time. At the end of each interval, the current job is temporarily set aside and another is allowed to execute during the next interval</td>

        <td>Application software</td>
        <td>consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine’s utilization</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>System software</td>
        <td>In contrast to application software, system software performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general. In a sense, the system software provides the infrastructure that the application software requires</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Utility software</td>
        <td>a class of system software units composed of programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Graphical user interface (GUI)</td>
        <td>modern user interfaces where objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons and users can issue commands using input devices </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Shell</td>
        <td>older user interfaces that communicated with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Kernel</td>
        <td>the internal part of an operating system that contains those software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Device driver</td>
        <td>software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times, directly with peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>File manager</td>
        <td>coordinates the use of the machine’s mass storage facilities; maintains records of all the files stored in mass storage, including where each file is located, which users are allowed to access the various files, and which portions of mass storage are available for new files or extensions to existing files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Memory manager</td>
        <td>part of the operating system that coordinates the system’s usage of main memory</td>

        <td>large “fictional” memory space created by paging</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Boot strapping</td>
        <td>performed by a computer each time it is turned on; procedure that transfers the operating system from mass storage (where it is permanently stored) into main memory (which is essentially empty when the machine is first turned on)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ROM</td>
        <td>read-only memory, a small portion of a computer’s main memory where the CPU expects to find its initial program is constructed from special nonvolatile memory cells</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Deadlock</td>
        <td>the condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Spooling</td>
        <td>technique of holding data for output at a later but more convenient time</td>
    </tr>

        <td>Super user (or administrator)</td>
        <td>person with highly privileged access to the operating system by identifying him- or herself as the administrator (usually by name and password) during the login procedure. Once this contact is established, the administrator can alter settings within the operating system, modify critical software packages, adjust the privileges granted to other users, and perform a variety of other maintenance activities that are denied normal users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Multi-factor authentication</td>
        <td>security solution against weak passwords that requires more than one piece of evidence to gain access</td>
