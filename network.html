                <li>Repeater: passes signals back and forth between the original two buses without considering the meaning of the signals when connecting networks. It regenerates the signal over the same network before the signal becomes too weak.</li>
                <li>Bridge: passes signals back and forth, but unlike a repeater, only passes messages specifically meant for a certain computer. It filters content by reading the source and destination. </li>
                <li>Switch: multiport bridge that can perform error checking before forwarding data</li>
                <li>Router: device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses</li>

                <li>Tier 3: access ISP, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying Internet access to individual homes and businesses. An example would be a company that provides Internet access to individuals within their organizations.</li>
