        <h2>Programming structures </h2>
        <h3>Sequential structures</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Top-down execution </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Decision structures</h3>

        <ul>
            <li> If </li>
            <li> Then </li>
            <li> Else </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Iterative (Looping)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>while loop: continue looping as long as something is true </li>
            <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true </li>
            <li>for loop: loop a given number of times </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recursive structures </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself </li>
            <li>Repetition continues until degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met. Degenerative case is also called a "base case." </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Two classic programming/database problems</h2>
        <h3>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting numbers</li>
            <li>Sorting strings (in accordance to ASCII values)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In database:</li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                    <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
            </ul></ul>
        <h3>Two popular search techniques </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
                <li>Binary search: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>only works if data is sorted first</li>
                <li>starts in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
            </ul></ul>
        <h2>Two class problem goals </h2>    
            <ul>
                <li>Efficiency: program takes miminal time and/or resources </li>
                <li>Correctness: program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions </li>
            </ul>
